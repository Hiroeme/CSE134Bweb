                    I was born at a very young age. I lived in Riverside, California for the majority of my life.

                <p>
                I love to spend my freetime reading manga and watching the latest, seasonal anime. It
                is especially fun to talk about these things with people I meet. If you want to chat with
                me about various manga, <em>PLEASE</em> feel free to contact me anytime!
                </p>

                <p>
                I'm not entirely set on what I want to do, but I have taken in interest in Software Engineering
                so I plan to stick with it for the time being.
